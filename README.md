# How do consumers preferences change over time? 

## Introduction
We are interested in the way the consumer preferences change over time. We are planning to research this phenomenon through different variables. Our dependent variable is going to be the viewers rating, and our explanatory variables are going to be: 
```
Genre			(Dummy)
Series vs. Movies 	(Dummy)
Running Time	        (Dummy)
Director		(Dummy)
Adult 			(Dummy) 
Region		        (Dummy)
Date			(Continuous String)

If movie > running time (Conditional Dummy)
if series > number of season and episodes
```
Lastly, we add general filters: First off, we'll only be looking at English movies and series, with their original title. Second off, we will have a cut off based on the number of votes on the movies and series. So, if the movie or serie has to little votes it will be cut out.

Perhaps the trend changed over time from, different running time lengths in movies or episodes of a serie, maybe the genre changed from horror to romantical.
